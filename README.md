# Kasarisw: Spinning Robot with LIDAR Navigation

## Overview
This project features a spinning robot using a repurposed LDS02RR LIDAR (fixed
mount, fake encoder for max sampling) to enable autonomous navigation and
object following/wall avoidance. The robot spins its body (500-2000 RPM),
measures rotation via ADXL373 accelerometer, and achieves directional movement
through differential motor RPM modulation.

See `kasarisw/README.md` for information about the software.
